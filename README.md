Photos Blog in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
HTML:
The HTML structure includes elements such as headers, navigation, photo containers, and footers. Each photo is wrapped in a container, which allows for individual styling and scripting.

CSS:
The CSS handles the styling of the HTML elements, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness. Media queries are used to make the blog responsive, ensuring it looks good on different screen sizes. Flexbox or CSS Grid might be used for layout management.

JavaScript:
JavaScript is used for interactive features like photo carousels, lightbox galleries, or dynamic loading of photos. Event listeners are added to handle user interactions.

Responsiveness:
To achieve responsiveness, media queries in CSS are employed to adjust the layout based on the screen size. For example:

On large screens, photos might be displayed in a grid layout.
On smaller screens, the layout might change to a single column to fit the narrow screen width.
Problem Statement: Contiguous Subarray Sum
Problem Explanation:
You need to determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within a given array of integers that sums up to a target value. If such a subarray exists, return true; otherwise, return false.

Example:

Input: arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5], target = 17
Output: true
Explanation: The subarray [7, 1, 9] sums up to 17.
Constraints:

The array size: 1 to 100,000 elements.
Element values and target sum: -1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000.
Expected time complexity: O(n).
Solution Explanation:
Approach: Sliding Window / Two-pointer Technique

Initialize: Start with two pointers, left and right, both at the beginning of the array. Initialize the current_sum to 0.
Expand Window: Move the right pointer to the right, adding the value at the right index to current_sum.
Shrink Window: If current_sum exceeds the target, move the left pointer to the right, subtracting the value at the left index from current_sum.
Check Sum: If current_sum equals the target at any point, return true.
Continue: Repeat steps 2-4 until the right pointer reaches the end of the array.
Return False: If no subarray is found by the end of the array, return false.
Why This Approach:

Efficiency: The sliding window technique ensures that each element is processed at most twice (once by right and once by left), resulting in O(n) time complexity.
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using a few extra variables.
Implementation:

javascript
Copy code
function hasSubarrayWithSum(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let current_sum = 0;

    for (let right = 0; right < arr.length; right++) {
        current_sum += arr[right];

        while (current_sum > target && left <= right) {
            current_sum -= arr[left];
            left++;
        }

        if (current_sum === target) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
}

// Example usage:
let arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5];
let target = 17;
console.log(hasSubarrayWithSum(arr, target));
This solution uses a sliding window to efficiently find if there is a subarray that sums up to the target, meeting the problem's constraints and expected time complexity.
